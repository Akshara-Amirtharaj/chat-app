# Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Authentication & Account Lifecycle
- **Signup/Login/Logout** with HttpOnly JWT cookies and CORS credentials
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Email verification placeholder** fields in user model
- **Account deletion** with both soft and hard delete modes
- **Data export** functionality (JSON streaming)

### 2. Security Enhancements
- **Rate limiting** on auth routes (5 attempts/15min), account deletion (3 attempts/hour)
- **Security headers** using Helmet.js
- **CORS configuration** with credentials support
- **Input validation** using express-validator

### 3. Database Models
- **Enhanced User model** with email verification, password reset, and workspace membership fields
- **Message model** with ownership transfer fields for cascade deletion
- **Soft delete** implementation with scheduled purge (30 days)

### 4. API Endpoints
- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration with validation
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /auth/check` - Current user + workspace memberships
- `DELETE /account?mode=soft|hard` - Account deletion with password confirmation
- `GET /account/export` - User data export

### 5. Scheduled Jobs
- **Daily purge job** at 02:00 server time to remove soft-deleted accounts

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create `.env` file in backend directory:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test API Endpoints

#### Signup
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"SecurePass123"}'
```

#### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"SecurePass123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt
```

#### Check Auth (with cookie)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/check \
  -b cookies.txt
```

#### Export Account Data
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/account/export \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -o account-export.json
```

#### Soft Delete Account
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:5000/api/account?mode=soft" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"SecurePass123"}' \
  -b cookies.txt
```

#### Hard Delete Account
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:5000/api/account?mode=hard" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"SecurePass123"}' \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### 5. Test Rate Limiting
Try making multiple requests to auth endpoints to see rate limiting in action.

### 6. Test Validation
Try signup with invalid data to see validation errors:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName":"J","email":"invalid-email","password":"123"}'
```
