# Frontend Fixes Applied

## âœ… Issue 1: Theme Not Working - FIXED

### Problem
All themes were showing the same colors because DaisyUI themes weren't properly configured.

### Solution
Updated `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to explicitly include all DaisyUI themes:

```javascript
daisyui: {
  themes: [
    "light", "dark", "cupcake", "bumblebee", "emerald", 
    "corporate", "synthwave", "retro", "cyberpunk", 
    "valentine", "halloween", "garden", "forest", "aqua", 
    "lofi", "pastel", "fantasy", "wireframe", "black", 
    "luxury", "dracula", "cmyk", "autumn", "business", 
    "acid", "lemonade", "night", "coffee", "winter", 
    "dim", "nord", "sunset"
  ],
}
```

### Result
Now when you select different themes in Settings, you should see distinct color schemes for each theme.

## âœ… Issue 2: Delete Account Option Missing - FIXED

### Problem
The delete account functionality was missing from the Profile page.

### Solution
Added comprehensive account management features:

#### 1. Updated Auth Store (`frontend/src/store/useAuthStore.js`)
- Fixed BASE_URL from port 5001 to 5000 (correct backend port)
- Added `deleteAccount()` function with soft/hard delete modes
- Added `exportAccountData()` function for data export
- Added `isDeletingAccount` loading state

#### 2. Enhanced Profile Page (`frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`)
- Added "Danger Zone" section with:
  - **Export Account Data** button
  - **Delete Account** button
- Added confirmation modal with:
  - Password verification
  - Soft vs Hard delete options
  - Clear warnings about permanent deletion

### Features Added:
- **Export Data**: Download all user messages and account info as JSON
- **Soft Delete**: Deactivate account with 30-day grace period
- **Hard Delete**: Immediate permanent deletion
- **Password Confirmation**: Required for both delete modes
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation
